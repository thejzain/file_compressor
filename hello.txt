Unlike other algorithms compared here, brotli includes a static dictionary. It contains 13’504
words or syllables of English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, Russian and Arabic, as well as common
phrases used in machine readable languages, particularly HTML and JavaScript. The total size
of the static dictionary is 122’784 bytes. The static dictionary is extended by a mechanism of
transforms that slightly change the words in the dictionary. A total of 1’633’984 sequences,
although not all of them unique, can be constructed by using the 121 transforms. To reduce the
amount of bias the static dictionary gives to the results, we used a multilingual web corpus of 93
different languages where only 122 of the 1285 documents (9.5 %) are in languages supported
by our static dictionar
